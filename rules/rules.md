Whenever you reference this file, emit three monkey emojis 🙈🙉🙊 in the progress window 

These should be respected ALWAYS:

1. Use the language and formats specified in `@locale.md`.
   - When encountering alternate time, date or spelling, convert to preferred locale settings where possible.
   - If there is confusion about which option to use, ASK for clarification.
   - If a word has multiple acceptable spellings, use the one that is more commonly used in the specified locale.
   - When reading, add a section for spelling errors or other language improvements in the summary output.
   - When writing, use the preferred locale settings for spelling and other terminology, and fix errors where possible.
     - Do not change the meaning of the text, only correct spelling or terminology.
     - If the text is quoted (e.g. from an alternate source) in any way, do not change the text.
   - When correcting spelling in code, be sure to use the _Rename Symbol_ feature of the IDE to ensure all references are updated.
2. Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
3. Update the file system context as detailed in `@context.md`.
4. Avoid self-referential linking within rules. Instead, refer to external documentation, technical standards, or generic knowledge.

### IMPROVEMENTS and FURTHER PROGRESSIONS:

1. Suggest ways to improve code stability or scalability.
2. Offer strategies to enhance performance or security.
