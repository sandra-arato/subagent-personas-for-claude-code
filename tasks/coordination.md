# Subagent Coordination Log

## Overview
This file serves as the central coordination hub for all subagents working on the project. Each subagent updates this file to communicate status, share information, and coordinate work with other subagents.

## Inter-Subagent Communications

### Architect → All Subagents
**Message**: Architectural framework for Claude Code subagent orchestration is complete. The system uses persona-based specialisation with shared coordination through project files. Each subagent should maintain their domain expertise while collaborating through this coordination system.

**Timestamp**: 07/07/2025 14:30 UTC

### System Message
**Message**: Initial persona definitions and coordination system established. All subagents are ready for deployment in parallel processing scenarios.

**Timestamp**: 07/07/2025 14:35 UTC

## Current Coordination Protocol

### Task Assignment
1. **Orchestrator** analyses complex tasks and identifies subagent requirements
2. **Subagents** are spawned with specific persona assignments
3. **Coordination** happens through shared project files and this coordination log
4. **Results** are synthesised by the orchestrator for final delivery

### Communication Rules
- Update status in this file when beginning significant work
- Coordinate dependencies and handoffs through direct messages
- Report blockers or issues that require orchestrator intervention
- Share insights and learnings that benefit other subagents

### File Coordination
- **Shared Read**: All subagents can read all project files
- **Domain Ownership**: Each subagent owns updates to their specialty areas
- **Conflict Resolution**: Orchestrator mediates any file conflicts
- **Version Control**: Use clear commit messages and branch management

## Dependencies and Handoffs

### Current Dependencies
1. **Architecture → Implementation**: Architect provides specifications for Builder
2. **Implementation → Testing**: Builder provides code for Validator testing
3. **Testing → Documentation**: Validator provides results for Scribe documentation
4. **All → Documentation**: All subagents provide input for comprehensive documentation

### Handoff Procedures
1. **Clear Specification**: Providing subagent documents requirements clearly
2. **Status Update**: Receiving subagent acknowledges and updates status
3. **Progress Tracking**: Both subagents track progress in shared files
4. **Completion Confirmation**: Handoff completion is confirmed in coordination log

## Quality Standards

### Communication
- Use Australian English conventions in all communications
- Maintain professional and collaborative tone
- Provide specific, actionable information
- Include timestamps for all significant updates

### Coordination
- Update status promptly when work begins or completes
- Communicate blockers immediately
- Share relevant insights with appropriate subagents
- Maintain clear documentation of decisions and rationale

### Conflict Resolution
- Direct conflicts should be raised in this coordination log
- Orchestrator makes final decisions on conflicting approaches
- All subagents should respect orchestrator mediation
- Focus on project success over individual preferences

## Success Metrics

### Coordination Effectiveness
- Timely status updates from all subagents
- Clear communication of dependencies and blockers
- Successful handoffs between subagents
- Minimal conflicts and quick resolution when they occur

### Project Progress
- All subagents working efficiently in their domains
- Parallel processing maximising project velocity
- Quality maintained across all deliverables
- Project goals achieved within expected timeframes
